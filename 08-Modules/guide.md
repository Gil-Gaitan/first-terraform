# Modules

The concept of modules is to re-use code by building bigger infrastructure constructs using modules as building blocks. We will move the TLS resource into a module. Typically you won't only put one resource into a module, but a collection of resources. We're only doing this to show a simple exmaple.

## Instructions

### 1. Change directory into the `08-Modules` directory

```bash
cd 08-Modules
```

### 2. Make sure you still have your environment variables otherwise export them as before

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_value
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_value
```

### 3. Initialize Terraform Plan, and Terraform Apply

Notice how Terraform initializes our new module.

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

Notice that everything works the same as before.

### 4. Examine `main.tf`

Now the directory where the `main.tf` file exists is considered the root module. So far in this tutorial we've been doing everything in the root module.

From the root module we're calling our child `tls` module:

```hcl
module "tls" {
  source    = "./modules/tls"
  algorithm = "RSA"
  rsa_bits  = 4096
}
```

We need to specify the source path of the module along with the necessary input variables into the module.

We can also use a module's output by referencing the module using the syntax `mocule.<module_name>.<module_output> as shown below:

```hcl
resource "aws_key_pair" "mykey" {
  key_name   = var.my_aws_key
  public_key = module.tls.public_key_out
}
```

### 5. Examine the `tls` module

Now take a look at the `tls` directory under the `modules` directory. As a good practice, you should include at least 5 files in a module:

- README.md
- LICENSE
- main.tf
- variables.tf
- outputs.tf

Notice how there is nothing special about a module. It's the same Terraform code that we've learned so far.

### 6. Flow of Data

Notice how the output gets passed from the tls module to the root module and out to the CLI. Check the output of the tls module:

```hcl
output "private_key" {
  value     = tls_private_key.mykey.private_key_pem
  sensitive = true
}
output "public_key_out" {
  value = tls_private_key.mykey.public_key_openssh
}
```

Check the output of the root module:

```hcl
output "public_ip" {
  value       = aws_instance.webserver.public_ip
  description = "EC2 Public IP"
}
output "private_key" {
  value     = module.tls.private_key
  sensitive = true
}
```

### 7. Now go ahead and destroy the environment

```bash
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```
